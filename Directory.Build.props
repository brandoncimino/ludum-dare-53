    Because Unity auto-generates .csproj files, we can't edit them directly. 
    However, the `Directory.Build.props` file is a sort of pseudo-.csproj that _will_ be respected -

    There are lots of "compiler-only" features that C# introduces. This means that, once compiled, the code will look like "old code".
    For example, the fancy new "switch expressions" are turned into normal switch statements when you compile your code, to make everything backwards-compatible.
    
    Unfortunately, Unity uses its own, out-dated compiler, which means that we still can't use any
    features after C# 9, even though Unity CAN run that code.
