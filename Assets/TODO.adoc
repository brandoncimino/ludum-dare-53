- [ ] Add link:../Directory.Build.props[] into the main template, so that we always get https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references[nullable reference types], https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-10.0/record-structs[record structs], and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-10.0/file-scoped-namespaces[file-scoped namespaces]

- [ ] Add link:Code/Standalone/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsExternalInit.cs[] to the main template, so that we always have access to records and the `init` keyword

- [ ] Promote link:./Code/Standalone/World.cs[`WorldLength` and `WorldPos`] into https://github.com/brandoncimino/brandon-utils[brandon-utils]
